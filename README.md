# Multi-label-Classification-of-Bengali-Hate-Comments-on-Social-Media

This model will utilize a multi-label classifier to determine the comment's toxicity type. We have decided to use six different classes for this classification, and they are as follows: insult, troll, threat, religious, hate, and vulgar.

In this project, we targeted to find the impact of applying various activation functions, optimizers, regularization, and normalization techniques. We have used a CNN-BiLSTM architecture
with BERT encoding and changed different parameters to find which works best.
